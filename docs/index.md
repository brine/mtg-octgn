### Install Card Images

OCTGN's game packages do not come installed with all of the card images.  The MTG game package includes a convenient _deck editor plugin_ which can locate and automatically install missing card images.

1. Open OCTGN's deck editor.
2. Under the **Deck** menu, select **New** -> **Magic the Gathering**
3. Allow OCTGN to load the MTG card database (may take a few seconds)
4. Under the **Plugins** menu, select **Magic: the Gathering Image Downloader**
