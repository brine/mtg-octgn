This is the Magic: the Gathering Game Definition for OCTGN.  You can always find the latest information on running M:tG with oCTGN at http://www.octgngames.com/mtg .

This game definition features the Autoscript system, which includes the Stack, card alignment, and simple card-based automation.  This system can be disabled by selecting "Enable/Disable Autoscripts" in the Table's right-click menu.

The Stack is designed to simulate the actual Stack found in the Magic rules. Actions such as casting a spell or activating/triggering an ability will place that card on the Stack zone in the game table.  In the case of an activated/triggered ability, a copy of that card will go on the stack, as an ability indicator.  While on the Stack, each card will have various rectangular-shaped markers which help you identify the nature of the card on the Stack.  Double-clicking on a card you control on the stack will resolve that spell/ability, and using the DEL hotkey will counter it.

Casting a spell, activating or triggering an ability, or resolving an object on the stack may also perform certain functions automatically.  For example, resolving the card 'Midnight Haunting' will automatically create two spirit tokens on the table for you.  These automations are simple and not designed to carry out complex card interactions or enforce game rules.  There are a lot of Magic cards available and many of them will not be automated, but we are working hard to expand the number of cards which are supported.

------UNIVERSAL OCTGN FUNCTIONS (not linked to game functions)------

(these work in ALL OCTGN games, not just Magic)

Zoom the Table
 -- Use the scroll wheel on a mouse.

Move/Pan the Table
 -- Hold the spacebar and click-drag the Table.

Increment/Decrement counters on a card
 -- Use the +/- keys on your keyboard's NUM pad while hovering over the counter.

Move counters from one card to another
 -- Click-drag the counter to the other card.

Target/untarget a card
 -- Hold SHIFT and click on the card.

draw an Arrow between two cards
 -- Hold SHIFT and click-drag from one card to the other.

Select multiple cards
 -- Either click-drag a selection box over the region of cards, or hold CTRL and click a card.

Play card face-down from your hand
 -- Click-Drag a card in your hand, then hold SHIFT as you drop the card onto the Table.


------MAGIC-SPECIFIC TABLE FUNCTIONS------

Pass Priority (TAB)
 -- Will announce to other players that you pass priority (don't have any responses.)
 -- If all players with Autoscripts enabled use the "Pass Priority" (TAB) action, it will automatically resolve the top-most card on the stack.

Auto-Pass Priority (F6)
 -- Enabling this option will automatically pass priority whenever a card is played or an ability is added to the stack.
 -- Autoscripts MUST be enabled for this to work.

Attach/Equip/Bond a card to another card (CTRL+Q)
 -- Target (shift-click) the card that will be the 'target' of the attachment.
 -- Right-click the Attachment card (Equipment/Aura, etc) and select "Attach to Targeted Card" (or use the CTRL+Q shortcut).
 NOTE! When you cast an Aura spell from your hand, if a card was already targeted, the autoscripts will automatically attach the Aura as it resolves.

Detaching a card (CTRL+Q)
 -- Using the "Attach to Targeted Card" (CTRL+Q) action on a card that is already attached to something else will detach that card from everything it's attached to.

Add a Smart Counter (CTRL+SHIFT+1)
 -- Some cards that add specific counters to other cards may set the 'Smart Counter' to that counter type during its automation.  You will notice this in the chat log after certain spells or abilities enter/leave the stack.
 -- After seeing the chat log notification, the 'Add Smart Counter' (CTRL+SHIFT+1) action will add one counter of that type to any card you perform the function on.
 -- The Smart Counter will persist until replaced by a different Smart Counter.

Auto-Add Counters (CTRL+1)
 -- If a card mentions a specific counter type, and is automated, 'Auto-Add Counter' will add 1 of that specific counter to the card.

Auto-Remove Counter (BACKSPACE)
 -- Will attempt to remove 1 counter that is most relevant on that card.
 -- Will prioritize the current Smart Counter, then a counter mentioned in that card's rules text (if that card is automated).  If there's only one type of counter on the card, then that counter will be removed.

Auto-Create Token (CTRL+SHIFT+T)
 -- If a card's rules mention a specific token (and it is automated), "Auto-Create Token" (CTRL+SHIFT+T) will create 1 of that specific token on the table.

Swap Token Artwork
 -- To display a particular token artwork (in the event that multiple arts are available), use the "Swap Token Artwork" action on that token.
  NOTE! The game will store the token artwork you chose, and will always display that artwork whenever that token is created.

Commander Toggle / Exclude from Alignment
 -- This card action will add or remove a Commander Marker on a card on the Table.
 -- While a Commander Marker is on the card, it will not be aligned during card alignment sweeps.
 -- Useful to mark your Commander (or anything exiled with cards like 'Oblivion Ring') as not-in-play so you can move them aside from gameplay.

Morph/Transform/Flip Card (CTRL+F)
 -- Will toggle a 'Transform' card (Innistrad Block) to switch to it's alternate side.
 -- Will turn a 'Flip' card (Kamigawa Block) to display its upside-down state.
 -- Will 'Morph' a card face-up or face-down if neither of the above conditions apply.  If the card has any Morph triggers (and is automated), a Morph ability will be added to the stack.

Turn Face-Up/Face-Down (CTRL+SHIFT+F)
 -- Manually forces a card face-up/Face-down, ignoring any autoscripts that may occur.

Use Activated Ability (CTRL+Z)
 -- Will display a list of buttons, with each button corresponding to a paragraph of rules text.
 -- Clicking one of those buttons will notify all players of the ability you wish to activate.
 -- If the card has an autoscripted ability, the button matching that ability will appear blue.
 -- Depending on the nature of that ability, the Autoscript engine will place a copy of the card on the stack, representing the chosen ability.

Shuffle Cards to Bottom of Library
 -- Will randomly move the selected cards to the bottom of your library.
 -- Selecting multiple cards will move them all.
 -- This is useful for abilities such as Cascade, if you reveal cards first by dragging them to the table.

Check Card Rulings (on Gatherer)
 -- Will open up your internet browser and link you to the card's Gatherer page


------MAGIC-SPECIFIC HAND FUNCTIONS------


Suspend Card
 -- This function will allow you to Suspend cards by inputting a number of time counters (suspend values are not yet autoscripted and must be inputted manually).
 -- Suspending a card will align it to the third row of the table with a special Suspend marker and the specified number of Time counters.
 -- Double-clicking a card with the Suspend marker will remove one time counter from it.
 -- Removing the last Time counter from a suspended card will move the card to the Stack (casting it).


------MAGIC-SPECIFIC HAND FUNCTIONS------


Scry (CTRL+SHIFT+C)
 -- Allows you to resolve scry triggers faster than manually viewing the top X cards of your deck.
 -- The first box asks how much you wish to scry for.  Enter the scry value and press OK.
 -- A new box will pop up with a list of buttons for each card you are scrying.
 -- To add a card to the BOTTOM of your deck, click the button with the card name.
 -- To add cards to the TOP of your deck (or switch back to BOTTOM), click the 'Switch to TOP' or 'Switch to BOTTOM' button on the bottom.
 -- The scry function will not rearrange your deck until all cards have been selected.  Cancelling out at any time will cancel the scry without rearranging.


------MAGIC-SPECIFIC GRAVEYARD FUNCTIONS------


Cast Spell (Flashback) (CTRL+F)
 -- Will cast the spell onto the stack, and then exiles it after it resolves.
  NOTE! It will also exile creatures, so don't use this for effects like Unearth!
